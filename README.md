# What is Node.Js

- Environment for running JS code outside of browser
- Built on Chrome's V8 JS engine
- Browser engine compiles our code to machine code
- It's is based on C++ and written in C++

# Node.Js vs JS in Browser

## Browser

1. DOM
2. Window
3. Interactive Apps
4. No Filesystem
5. Fragmentation
6. ES6 Modules

## **Node**

1. No DOM
2. No Window :- Unlike browser we can't use window object and it's property
3. Server Side App
4. Filesystem
5. Versions
6. CommonJS

# Node.Js features

## REPL

Read Evaluate Print Loop. Evaluate Node Code  

## CLI

 Command line interface

## Node Modules

- CommonJS, every file is module (by default)
- Modules - Encapsulated Code (only share minimum)
- If a module is envoling a function in itself then just by importing it in other file it will invoke that function without explicitly calling in that file.
